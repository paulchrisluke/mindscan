## Literature review changes methodology {{ date: '2023-06-07T00:00Z' }}

I met with Rich, a Doctor I met in Amsterdamn during my travels. We have always enjoyed riffing together, and I discussed changes in our approach based on Microsofts paper, "Fake it Till You Make It":

E. Wood, T. Baltrušaitis, C. Hewitt, S. Dziadzio, M. Johnson, V. Estellers, T. J. Cashman, and J. Shotton, “Fake It Till You Make It: Face analysis in the wild using synthetic data alone,” arXiv:2109.15102 [cs.CV], 2021.

In short, Microsoft used procedural generation to create datasets based on just 2000 base images. This drastically reduces the cost required to gather MRI images, and sets an effective goalpost for this project in terms of the number of source MRI images we will need to attain. 

He agreed that this approach sounds reasonable, and went over the basics of reading MRI scans.

I also adjusted this webapp, created the /paper page, which I will need to get some help on in the React side later.

Overall, the approach outlined by Microsoft seems plausible. More literature review is needed, and I will continue to educate myself and find collaboraters/experts in this field to grow this project.

## Initial Commit {{ date: '2023-06-04T00:00Z' }}

In this initial release I have built this website to track ongoing progress for this research paper. The site is built in React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS, using a tailwind template "Commit". In the future, each project update will be displayed in this feed, while the paper is updated.
