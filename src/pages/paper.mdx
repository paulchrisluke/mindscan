The pivotal study by Barnes et al. (1997) stands as a hallmark in functional brain mapping, marking a decisive stride in dynamic 3-D PET imaging[^1^]. By pioneering real-time brain activity monitoring, their work established PET imaging as a cornerstone for unraveling functional brain regions' temporal and spatial dynamics. This seminal advancement in imaging methodologies has played a catalytic role in inspiring the integration of AI techniques to extract nuanced insights from intricate neural activities.

The contribution of Faisan et al. (2005) resonates deeply with our research orientation, introducing unsupervised learning techniques for mapping active brain functional MRI (fMRI) signals[^2^]. The employment of hidden semi-Markov event sequence models provided a means to unearth latent patterns within fMRI data, offering a deeper understanding of functional networks' interplay during various cognitive tasks. This insight underscored the need to bridge the gap between simulated and real data domains, catalyzing our exploration of synthetic data for AI-driven research in brain mapping.

Advancements in neural interfaces brought the work of Wang et al. (2023) to the forefront, showcasing real-time functional brain mapping capabilities[^3^]. Through the integration of high-channel-count, ultra-conformal neural interfaces, their research accentuated the potential for achieving unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution in brain activity mapping. This development aligns seamlessly with our endeavor to explore three-dimensional modeling derived from procedurally-generated synthetic datasets, bridging the gap between cutting-edge imaging techniques and AI methodologies.
