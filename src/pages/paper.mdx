## Introduction {{ date: '2023-07-13T00:00Z' }}

The field of medical imaging has witnessed significant advancements with the integration of AI technologies. However, the availability of high-quality and well-annotated datasets remains a crucial requirement for training accurate and reliable AI models. This proposal addresses the need for a large-scale MRI dataset, encompassing diverse imaging data and associated annotations, to propel AI research in medical imaging forward.

## Research/Study Background

We demonstrate the feasibility of applying computer vision techniques to brain mapping using synthetic data exclusively. While the utilization of synthesized training data has been prevalent in various domains, the domain gap between real and synthetic data remains a significant challenge, particularly in the context of brain images. Previous efforts have attempted to address this gap through data mixing, domain adaptation, and domain-adversarial training. However, we present compelling evidence that synthesizing data with minimal domain gap enables models trained on synthetic data to generalize effectively to real-world in-the-wild brain image datasets. In this paper, we outline the methodology of combining a procedurally-generated parametric 3D brain model with an extensive library of carefully crafted assets to render training images with unparalleled realism and diversity. Our machine learning systems are trained on these synthetic brain images, enabling us to accomplish brain-related tasks such as precise landmark localization and brain region segmentation. We demonstrate that synthetic data can achieve comparable accuracy to real data while also enabling novel approaches that would otherwise be infeasible due to the challenges associated with manual labeling in brain mapping studies.

## Aim and Objectives

The primary objectives of this collaborative project are as follows:

**a) Acquire a large-scale dataset:** Collaborate with medical institutions, hospitals, and research centers to collect a substantial number of MRI scans representing various anatomical regions and medical conditions.

Additionally, following the principles outlined in Microsoft's research paper on "Fake It Till You Make It: Face analysis in the wild using synthetic data alone" (Wood et al., 2021), we aim to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic, non-identifiable brain scan datasets. By employing GANs, we can create realistic brain scans that preserve the statistical properties and anatomical features of real scans while ensuring the privacy and anonymity of individuals. This approach allows us to advance AI research in brain mapping without compromising the confidentiality of sensitive personal data.

**b) Ensure data quality:** Implement stringent quality control measures to ensure the acquired scans adhere to high imaging standards, minimizing artifacts and distortions.

As MRI scans require specialized expertise for accurate interpretation and evaluation, we will establish a collaborative partnership with experts specializing in MRI scans and brain imaging. This collaboration will involve leveraging their knowledge and experience to perform comprehensive quality checks on the acquired MRI scans. These experts will employ their expertise to assess the scans for any potential artifacts, distortions, or image inconsistencies, ensuring that the dataset meets the highest standards of imaging quality. Additionally, in conjunction with the generated synthetic brain scan datasets mentioned earlier, the experts will perform thorough evaluations to validate the fidelity and accuracy of the synthetic data. By incorporating these expert evaluations, we aim to create a high-quality dataset that can be relied upon for advanced AI research in brain mapping and analysis.

**c) Data annotation and labeling:** Engage domain experts to annotate the dataset with relevant clinical information, including anatomical landmarks, abnormalities, and clinical outcomes, enhancing its value for supervised learning and further research applications.

## Literature Review:

The domain of functional brain mapping has undergone substantial evolution, driven by advancements in imaging techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. This literature review delves into key contributions that have enriched our understanding of functional brain mapping, spanning dynamic PET imaging, unsupervised learning in functional MRI (fMRI), real-time mapping with neural interfaces, and the innovative application of synthetic data in AI research.

The study by Barnes et al. (1997) marked a seminal advancement in functional brain mapping using dynamic 3-D PET imaging[^1^]. This work laid a foundation for capturing real-time brain activity by characterizing the capabilities of PET imaging in delineating functional brain regions. Their findings illuminated the potential of PET imaging to reveal temporal and spatial dynamics of brain function, stimulating further research in this domain.

Faisan et al. (2005) contributed to the field by introducing unsupervised learning methodologies for active brain functional MRI signal mapping[^2^]. Employing hidden semi-Markov event sequence models, they unveiled latent patterns within fMRI data. This research augmented our comprehension of functional networks, shedding light on the intricate interplay of brain regions during different cognitive tasks, thus paving the way for a deeper exploration of functional brain dynamics.

Recent progress in neural interfaces has yielded real-time functional brain mapping capabilities, as exemplified by the work of Wang et al. (2023)[^3^]. Their study showcased the integration of high-channel-count, ultra-conformal neural interfaces for capturing neural signals in real-time. This development holds promise for achieving unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution in brain activity mapping, enabling a finer-grained understanding of cognitive processes.

Furthermore, the study conducted by Wood et al. (2021) introduced a new perspective by leveraging synthetic data for AI-driven insights[^4^]. Their approach resonates with the broader context of our research, showcasing the efficacy of using synthetic data to address data privacy concerns. While their work primarily focused on face analysis, the concept of using synthetic data to bridge the gap between simulated and real data domains is pertinent to our objective of safeguarding health data privacy.

In synthesis, these pivotal contributions collectively showcase the trajectory of functional brain mapping research. From dynamic PET imaging and unsupervised learning in fMRI to real-time neural interfaces and the innovative use of synthetic data, each advancement has contributed to our ability to decode the complex orchestration of brain function. The confluence of these methodologies and insights underscores the multidisciplinary nature of functional brain mapping, wherein AI and advanced imaging techniques converge to unravel the intricate dynamics of the human brain.

## Methodology:

The project implementation can be divided into the following key phases:

**a) Partnership establishment:** Identify potential collaborators, including academic institutions, hospitals, and research centers, interested in contributing to the dataset creation effort.

Notably, we have already identified potential collaborators who have expressed their interest in contributing to our initiative. These collaborators include a distinguished doctor specializing in neuroscience and MRI imaging from Seattle, an experienced AI engineer with expertise in machine learning and data analysis from the Netherlands, and a knowledgeable lawyer specializing in privacy and data protection regulations from North Carolina.

We believe that the involvement of such diverse and accomplished professionals will greatly enrich the dataset creation process, bringing valuable insights from different domains. Their collective expertise will contribute to the overall quality and relevance of the dataset, ensuring that it meets the needs and requirements of researchers, developers, and other stakeholders in the field of AI-driven brain mapping.

If you or anyone you know is interested in collaborating with us on this project, please do not hesitate to reach out. We welcome additional partnerships and contributions as we work together to advance the frontiers of AI research in brain mapping and understanding.

**b) Data acquisition:** Collaborate with medical imaging departments to secure access to MRI scans obtained from diverse patient populations, covering a wide range of medical conditions and imaging protocols.

Collaborating with medical imaging departments, particularly through partnerships with hospitals or research groups, presents an ideal avenue for securing access to the necessary volume of MRI scans obtained from diverse patient populations, encompassing a wide range of medical conditions and imaging protocols.

The acquisition of a significant number of MRI scans through traditional means can be a time-consuming endeavor. On average, an MRI scan takes approximately one hour to complete. If we were to conduct six scans per day, six days a week, we would accumulate a considerable amount of data after one year of effort. However, it is important to acknowledge that such an approach would entail substantial costs and logistical challenges, necessitating grant or funding support to sustain the endeavor.

Fortunately, our utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offers a promising alternative. GANs enable us to generate synthetic data, including brain scans, using a limited number of original scans as a training set. By partnering with healthcare providers and leveraging their existing databases, we have the potential to acquire a more extensive dataset that would serve as the foundation for training our GAN models. This collaborative approach, combined with AI techniques, can augment our data acquisition capabilities and overcome the limitations associated with solely relying on independently acquired scans.

By strategically combining real MRI scans with generated data, we can create a robust and diverse dataset that encompasses a broad spectrum of anatomical variations and medical conditions. This hybrid approach strikes a balance between acquiring scans directly and using synthetic data, enabling us to overcome the resource-intensive nature of solely relying on traditional data acquisition methods.

**c) Data curation and annotation:** Assemble a multidisciplinary team of experts in medical imaging and AI to meticulously curate and annotate the collected data, ensuring comprehensive and accurate annotations.

**d) Dataset hosting and accessibility:** Explore partnerships with established platforms or repositories known for their robust infrastructure and open-access policies, ensuring wide accessibility to the curated MRI dataset for researchers worldwide.

## Study Limitations: {{ date: '2023-07-13T00:00Z' }}

While this research endeavor seeks to contribute substantially to the field of AI-driven medical imaging, it is important to acknowledge several inherent limitations that may influence the scope and generalizability of the findings. These limitations are essential for contextualizing the results and interpreting their implications accurately.

**1. Limited Availability of High-Quality MRI Data at Scale:**

One of the foremost limitations pertains to the availability of comprehensive and high-quality MRI data on a large scale. Despite concerted efforts to collaborate with medical institutions and research centers, the acquisition of a diverse and extensive MRI dataset encompassing various anatomical regions and medical conditions remains a complex undertaking. The scarcity of meticulously annotated MRI scans for both synthetic and real data hampers the potential to comprehensively address the research questions posed in this study.

**2. Domain Gap in Synthetic Data Realism:**

A significant challenge lies in addressing the domain gap between synthetic and real data. While synthetic data generation techniques, such as GANs, have demonstrated promising outcomes in preserving anatomical features and statistical properties, the inherent divergence in data distributions remains a constraint. Despite our emphasis on minimizing this gap, the extent to which AI models trained on synthetic data can generalize to the intricacies of real-world brain images requires vigilant consideration.

**3. Complexity of Brain Imaging Interpretation:**

The complexity of brain imaging interpretation poses another noteworthy limitation. Expert evaluation and annotation of MRI scans, especially when dealing with intricate anatomical landmarks and abnormalities, are subject to inherent inter-observer variability. Although collaborative efforts with domain experts are incorporated to ensure data quality and consistency, the intricacies of brain image analysis may still introduce nuances that influence the model's performance and potential biases.

**4. Challenges in Clinical Relevance:**

The translation of AI-driven research findings into clinically relevant applications remains a challenge. While AI models trained on synthetic data may demonstrate promising performance within controlled experimental settings, the transition to real clinical scenarios demands rigorous validation and validation. The intricacies of clinical decision-making and the potential impact on patient care must be considered beyond the scope of this study.

In summary, this investigation, while innovative in its approach to AI-driven medical imaging, is not without its limitations. These limitations underscore the complex interplay between data availability, domain adaptation, ethical considerations, and clinical applicability. Acknowledging and addressing these limitations serves as a foundation for future research endeavors, promoting a comprehensive understanding of the implications of AI technologies in the field of medical imaging.
